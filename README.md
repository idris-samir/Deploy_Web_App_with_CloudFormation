This is second project from the Cloud DevOps Engineering Udacity Course.

I created two cloud formation scripts: "network.yml" and "servers.yml".

I also created parameter files: "network-parameters.json" and "server-parameters-json"
and then used them in their respective script.

The servers.yml script uses outputs from the network.yml script.
